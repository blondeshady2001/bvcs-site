  a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
  completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

  action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his/her conduct
  was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit, or preceding by
  judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
  contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
  a Director or an officer did not act in good faith and in a manner which
  he/she reasonable believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests
  of this Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or
  proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his/her conduct was

  Director or officer of this Corporation or is or was serving at the request
  of this Corporation as a Director or officer of another corporation,
  partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses
  (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him/her

  believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of this Corporation.<br><br>
  
  <strong>Section 4.   Determination Required. </strong> Any indemnification under this Article IX shall
  be made by a determination that the indemnification of the Director or
  officer is proper in the circumstances because he/she has met the
  applicable standard of conduct set forth in such subsection.  Such
  determination shall be made:
  
</p>
<ul><strong>a)</strong> By the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum
      consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or
      proceeding;<br><br>

<strong>b)</strong> If such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, a
      majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by

  determined that he/she is entitled to be indemnified by this Corporation
  as authorized in this Article IX.<br><br>
  
  <strong>Section 6.   Nonexclusivity; Duration. </strong> The indemnification provided by this Article
  IX shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those
  seeking indemnification may be entitled under any agreement, vote of
  disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in their official
  capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office
  and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director or
  officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
  administrators of such person.<br><br>
  
  <strong>Section 7.   Insurance.  </strong>This Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
  insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director or officer of
  the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of this Corporation as
  a Director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
  trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him/her
  and incurred by him/her in any such capacity, or arising out of status as
  such, whether or not this Corporation would have the power to
  indemnify him/her against such liability under the provisions of this
  Article IX. <br><br>
  
  <strong>Section 8.   Applicability to Other Persons. </strong> The provisions of this Article IX may be
