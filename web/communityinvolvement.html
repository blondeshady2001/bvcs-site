<h1>Beaver Valley Choral Society's Community Involvement</h1>
	  <p>Throughout our history, 
  the Beaver Valley Choral Society has been proud to contribute to the community 
  in various ways. In addition to the yearly Philip H. Inman Excellence in Choral 
  Conducting Arts Scholarship, contributions have been made to the Beaver County 
  Bicentennial Celebration, American Cancer Society, Pittsburgh CLO Academy, Salvation 
  Army Hurricane Katrina Fund, Lincoln Park Performing Arts Center, and Rochester 
  Theater Renovation Project. We have enjoyed singing Christmas carols for Rochester's 
  Light-up Night, performing with the American Wind Symphony Orchestra for the 
  Beaver Valley International Arts Festival, joining the Geneva College Concert 
  Band at their Spring Concert, and singing at the Beaver County Bicentennial 
  Celebration at the courthouse. In continuing our tradition of community involvement, 
  the Choral Society is always looking for new places and new faces with which 
  to &quot;Share Our Joy, Share Our Song!&quot;        </p>

<h1>Beaver Valley Choral Society's use of an AED</h1>
<p>The Beaver Valley Choral 
  Society identified a possible need for emergency medical care for members of 
  the choir and the audience during performances. The Choral Society purchased 
  an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). An AED is a computerized medical 
  device that can check a person's heart rhythm and administer a shock if necessary. 
  The AED uses lights, voice, and visual prompts to tell the rescuer the steps 
  to take until medical help arrives. The cardiac arrest survival rate is only 
  about five percent if an AED is not available. When bystanders provide immediate 
  CPR and a shock, if necessary, the survival rate can be as high as forty-eight 
  to seventy-four percent.<br>
  <br>
  Several members of the Choral Society volunteered to attend the HeartSaver CPR-AED 
  class offered by the American Red Cross. In addition to our members who are 
  healthcare professionals, there are now volunteers present at each concert trained 
  in CPR and in the operation of the AED. The Choral Society is proud to help 
  the America Heart Association (AHA) with their program of risk reduction for 
  heart disease and heart attack. At each of our concerts, we have information available from the AHA outlining 
  risk factors for heart disease and a quiz to determine your personal risk of 
  heart disease. The members of the Beaver Valley Choral Society are pleased to 
  help keep your heart musically happy and physically healthy. <br><br>
